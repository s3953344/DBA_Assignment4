# React + TypeScript + Vite
Made by Frederick Hadi (s3953344). The app implements pagination because rendering 5555 search results takes a long time. Bookings are stored using the embedded approach. You can see all the test bookings I made in the first property listing (which has the name Ribera something).

Run the following commands to boot up the web app:
- npm install
- npm run mongo
- npm run dev


These commands will install all dependencies, boot up the MongoDB Atlas connection, and then start the web app

Mongo server: PORT 3000

React app: PORT 5173
